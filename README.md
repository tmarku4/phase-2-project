### Description:
The `App.js` file serves as the main component for an exotic car dealership web application. It utilizes React and React Router for navigation and state management.

### Dependencies:
- React
- React Router
- Bootstrap (assuming it's included in the project)

- Props:
  - `setSearchText`: Function to update the search text.
  - `buyCar`: Function to handle the car purchase.
  - `increaseLikes`: Function to handle the increase in car likes.

#### 2. `Home` Component
- Renders the home page.

#### 3. `NewCarForm` Component

#### 7. Other Components:

### State:
- `cars`: State variable to store the list of cars.
- `formData`: State variable to store form data for adding new cars.
- `searchText`: State variable for the search bar.

### Hooks:
- `useEffect`: Fetches the list of cars from the server on component mount.
- `useState`: Manages the state variables mentioned above.

### Functions:
- `buyCar`: Deletes a car from the list when purchased.
- `addCar`: Sends a POST request to add a new car.
- `updateFormData`: Updates the form data on user input.

### Routing:
- Utilizes React Router for navigation.
- Defines routes for the home page, car list, add car form, and car information.

### Presentation:
- Main container with a logo and router provider for rendering components based on routes.

### External Dependencies:
- Assumes the existence of a local server (`http://localhost:3000`) for fetching and updating car data.

### Additional Notes:
- The project seems to have a clean and modular structure with well-defined components and functions.
- Make sure to uncomment the necessary components like `Search` and `Header` if needed.
- Verify the correctness of the server URL in the fetch requests.
